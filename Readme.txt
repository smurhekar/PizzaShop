Make-Your-Own-Piiizzzzaaaa Corner:-

As an upcoming entrepreneur, I am all excited to start my own pizza corner. I want start with below menu (currently only 1 size -10" pizza):-

American - 5$
Indian - 4$
Mexican - 6$
Other than price, here is what’s different:-

Heating temperature - Say American Pizza would be heated @ 200 Degrees while Indian would be @ 225 & Mexican would be @ 275
Cheese - American Cheddar Cheese, Indian - Mozzarella Cheese, Mexican - Parmigiano Cheese
While selecting a pizza, one can choose to 1. Select a pizza base (Normal or Wheat) - Normal Included in Cost of base Pizza, Wheat - 1 $ 2. Select (Thick crust or Thin crust or Pan) - Thick Crust Included in cost, Thin Crust - .5 $ extra, Pan Pizza - .75 $ less 3. Additional toppings - Maximum toppings can be up to 3.

a. Black Olives

b. Crisp Capsicum

c. Mushroom

d. Golden Corn

e. Pineapple

f. Fresh Tomato

g. Jalapeno

h. Red Pepper

i. Gherkins & Babycorn

a to d has a price tag associated of .5 $, e to f has a price tag of .60 and g to i has a price tag of .75$

Pineapple can’t be selected with Jalapeno

Red Pepper can’t be selected with Mushroom

(In future I may put more restrictions or reduce my restrictions) Other inputs:-

Currently only these 3 customizations are possible.

@each step it should inform me about my current billing.

Finally, it should give me an option to confirm the order or cancel the same. Once ordered it should tell me my order details and final amount to pay along with the details of customization. Once paid it should serve me the pizza.

In future, I can expand my menu by adding either more pizza menu items or by increasing more customization such as with or without extra cheese, with or without extra toppings.

Happy coding!! :smiley:
